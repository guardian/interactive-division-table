We have shown today that, where there is good reason to extend debate further, we are willing to consider it very seriously and carefully indeed. I hope my right hon. and learned Friend will take that assurance in the spirit in which it is intended.\r\n\r\nI hope that the House will recognise that it is in the national interest that we put this Bill on the statute book and that we deliver the democratic verdict of the British people in a way that allows businesses and individuals to plan for their future, confident in what the law will be on and after exit day. I hope that the House will therefore give a clear vote for the Bill on Second Reading.\r\n\r\nQuestion put, That the amendment be made.","HansardIdentifier":"d1225","AyeCount":"296","NoeCount":"318","House":"Commons","Section":"Main Chamber","Number":"13","AyeMembers":{"Member":[{"Id":"172","Name":"Abbott, Ms
